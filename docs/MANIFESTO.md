# The Ralph Manifesto

## Stupid Ideas Win.

Every billion-dollar company started as a stupid idea.

"Strangers sleeping in your house?" → Airbnb.
"Strangers driving you around?" → Uber.
"140 characters?" → Twitter.
"People watching other people play video games?" → Twitch.

The pattern is clear: **the ideas that sound dumbest are often the smartest.**

But here's the problem: most people kill their stupid ideas before they even try them. They self-censor. They overthink. They wait for the "perfect" idea that never comes.

**Ralph doesn't do that.**

Ralph is the kid who says the thing everyone's thinking but nobody says. The innocent genius who stumbles into brilliance by not knowing what's "impossible."

That's the energy we're bringing to startup ideation.

## What Is IdeaRalph?

IdeaRalph is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) that turns Claude into your stupid-smart startup co-founder.

**It's not an app. It's not a website. It's a superpower for Claude Code.**

When you install IdeaRalph, Claude gains the ability to:

- **Brainstorm** ideas that sound dumb but are actually genius
- **Validate** ideas on 10 PMF (Product-Market Fit) dimensions
- **Iterate** relentlessly until your idea scores 9.5+
- **Generate PRDs** from napkin sketch to investor-ready
- **Design** your UI with one question: "What vibe?"
- **Plan architecture** with the right tech stack
- **Create checklists** for YC-level launch prep

All in one conversation. All locally. All free.

## The Ralph Loop

This is the core mechanic. The thing that makes Ralph different.

```
     ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
     │                                     │
     ▼                                     │
  BRAINSTORM → VALIDATE → ITERATE ─────────┘
                            │
                            ▼ (when score ≥ 9.5)
                           PRD
                            │
                            ▼
                         DESIGN
                            │
                            ▼
                      ARCHITECTURE
                            │
                            ▼
                        CHECKLIST
                            │
                            ▼
                          SHIP IT
```

**The loop doesn't stop until your idea is dope.**

Ralph scores your idea on 10 dimensions:
1. Problem Clarity
2. Market Size
3. Uniqueness
4. Feasibility
5. Monetization
6. Timing
7. Virality
8. Defensibility
9. Team Fit
10. Ralph Factor (sounds dumb, actually genius)

If your score is below 9.5, Ralph identifies the weak spots and iterates. Again and again until it's undeniably good.

## How to Get Started

### Step 1: Have Claude Code

If you don't have Claude Code yet:
- Go to [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code)
- Install the CLI
- This is your vibe coding environment

### Step 2: Install IdeaRalph MCP

One command. That's it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibeforge1111/vibeship-idearalph.git ~/idearalph && cd ~/idearalph/mcp-server && npm i && npm run build && claude mcp add idearalph -- node ~/idearalph/mcp-server/dist/index.js
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Code

```
/exit
```

Then open Claude Code again:

```
claude
```

### Step 4: Talk to Ralph

Just start talking. Ralph is now part of Claude.

Try:
- "Brainstorm startup ideas about productivity for remote workers"
- "Validate this idea: an app that pays you to walk"
- "Iterate on this until it scores 9.5+"
- "Generate a PRD for this idea"
- "Design the UI - I want a clean vibe"
- "Plan the architecture"
- "Create a launch checklist"

**Talk to Ralph like you're talking to a friend.**

## The Hackathon: "The Ralph Loop"

### What Is It?

A vibe-coding competition where you use IdeaRalph to go from stupid idea → shipped product.

The best projects win $RALPH tokens.

### How It Works

1. **Get an invite code** (DM us or get one from a friend)
2. **Register** at idearalph.com/hackathon
3. **Install the MCP** (see above)
4. **Build something** using the Ralph flow
5. **Submit your project** with your PRD and live URL
6. **Win tokens** based on your category and score

### Categories

| Category | What Wins |
|----------|-----------|
| **Stupid Smart** | Most Ralph energy - sounds dumb, actually genius |
| **Speed Run** | Fastest from idea to deployed product |
| **Loop Master** | Highest PMF score achieved |
| **Vibe Ship** | Best use of SvelteKit + Supabase stack |
| **Community Choice** | Most votes from the community |

### Prizes

**15% of total $RALPH supply** goes to hackathon winners:
- Grand Prize (1): 20% of prize pool
- Category Winners (5): 8% each
- Top 20 Finalists: 2% each

### Timeline

- **Registration**: Now
- **Building**: 2 weeks
- **Submissions**: [date TBA]
- **Winners**: [date TBA]

## $RALPH Tokenomics

| Allocation | % |
|------------|---|
| Seedify | 35% |
| Community (X campaigns) | 40% |
| Hackathon Prizes | 15% |
| Liquidity | 10% |

**No team allocation. Fair launch. Community first.**

## Preparing for the Hackathon

### Before You Start

1. **Install Claude Code** if you haven't
2. **Install the IdeaRalph MCP** (command above)
3. **Practice the flow** - brainstorm a few ideas, see how scoring works
4. **Get familiar with the stack** (SvelteKit + Supabase recommended, but not required)

### Winning Tips

1. **Embrace the stupid** - The "Ralph Factor" is a real scoring dimension. Dumb-sounding ideas that are actually smart score higher.

2. **Document your journey** - Show your iteration process. Going from 5.2 → 7.8 → 9.5 is more impressive than starting at 9.0.

3. **Ship fast** - A deployed MVP beats a perfect mockup. Speed Run category rewards velocity.

4. **Use the full flow** - Projects that use Brainstorm → PRD → Design → Architecture → Checklist show mastery.

5. **Make it viral** - Community Choice is voted. Build something people want to share.

### What Makes a Winning Project?

- **Real problem**: Not a solution looking for a problem
- **Unique angle**: What's your "stupid smart" twist?
- **Shipped**: Live URL, working product
- **Ralph artifacts**: PRD, design spec, architecture plan
- **Story**: How did your idea evolve through the loop?

## The Vibe Coding Philosophy

IdeaRalph is part of a bigger movement: **vibe coding**.

Vibe coding means:
- Building with feeling, not just logic
- Shipping fast, iterating faster
- Embracing imperfection
- Trusting the process
- Having fun

Traditional startup advice: "Validate for months before building."
Vibe coding advice: "Ship it this weekend and see what happens."

Ralph embodies this. He doesn't overthink. He doesn't wait for permission. He just... helps.

## Join Us

The future of startups isn't pitch decks and accelerators.

It's one person with Claude Code, an idea that sounds stupid, and the audacity to ship it.

**That person could be you.**

Install the MCP.
Enter the hackathon.
Build something stupid smart.
