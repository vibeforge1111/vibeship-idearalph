## Project Submission System

### What Users Submit

1. **Project Name** - The startup name
2. **Tagline** - One-line pitch
3. **Live URL** - Deployed project (required)
4. **GitHub Repo** - Source code (optional but recommended)
5. **Ralph Artifacts:**
   - PRD (generated by Ralph)
   - Design spec (if used)
   - Architecture plan (if used)
   - Final PMF scores
6. **Demo Video** - 2-minute Loom or YouTube (optional)
7. **Wallet Address** - For token distribution

### Verification

**How we verify Ralph was used:**
1. PRD structure matches Ralph's output format
2. PMF scores present with all 10 dimensions
3. "Ralph says" quote included
4. Timestamps show progression (brainstorm → PRD → launch)

**Anti-Gaming:**
- Manual review for top 50 projects
- Community can flag suspicious entries
- Duplicate detection on ideas/code

## Open Questions

2. **Judging panel**: Team only, or include community judges?
3. **Geographic restrictions**: Any regions excluded?
4. **Project requirements**: Must be new, or can improve existing?
5. **Team size**: Solo only, or teams allowed?

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Finalize token allocation percentages
2. [ ] Set exact dates for hackathon
3. [ ] Create Genesis code list (100 codes)
4. [ ] Build `/hackathon` landing page
5. [ ] Set up Supabase tables
6. [ ] Write launch tweet thread
7. [ ] Prepare Genesis code distribution (who gets them?)
